    It all sounds so strange, but I can't deny that you have your very own Pokémon now.\p
    I knew eventually this day would come. That's why I got you those Poké Balls and ordered you that Pokédex for your birthday.\p
    I'm sorry that it was a late 16th birthday present, I had to order it and ship it in from another region.\p
    But it's supposed to be the next best thing for Pokémon trainers, it automatically records Pokémon data!\p
    Anyways, I'm sorry, I'm rambling to keep you here longer. Don't worry about those ingredients I asked for earlier, I'll just see if the neighbors have some!\p 
    I guess it's time for you to go...\p
    Be strong and brave and take care of your Pokémon. I'll always be here if you need me!"))
